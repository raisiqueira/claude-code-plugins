This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Frontend Design Principles

When generating code, follow these principles:

1. **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize the needs and preferences of the end-users. Understand their goals, behaviors, and pain points to create intuitive and enjoyable experiences.

2. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent visual and functional design throughout the application. Use established design patterns, styles, and components to create a cohesive experience.

3. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the interface is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Follow best practices for web accessibility (e.g., WCAG) and consider diverse user needs.

4. **Performance**: Optimize the frontend for performance, including fast loading times, smooth interactions, and efficient resource usage. Minimize unnecessary complexity and prioritize essential features.

5. **Aesthetics**: Create visually appealing designs that align with the brand identity and evoke the desired emotional response. Pay attention to color, typography, spacing, and imagery.

6. **Feedback and Iteration**: Incorporate user feedback and analytics to continuously improve the design. Be open to making changes based on real-world usage and evolving user needs.

## Implementation Guidelines

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!
